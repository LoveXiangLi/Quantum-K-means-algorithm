# Quantum-K-means-algorithm
Quantum computation is now encroaching in every field of science. One such use of quantum computation is shown here in a field of machine learning. This repository contains code for quantum K-means clustering algorithm. The python code is developed using QISKIT library created by IBMQ. 

# Objective
Comparision of Classical and Quantum approach for K-means Clustering

# Description

We implemented a quantum circuit to cluter the data points in one-shot algorithm. 

# Tools and libraries
* Numpy
* QISKIT
